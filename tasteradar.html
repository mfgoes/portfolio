                <!-- Text 1 -->
                <p>
                    Tasteradar is a mobile application that aims to simplify the process of finding and choosing local food experiences. As the UX Lead and Founder of the startup, I played a key role in shaping the business proposition and leading the UX process, which included conducting user research, market research, usability testing, and designing user flows through prototypes.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Problem Statement: </strong>
                    <br>
                    Dining with friends often becomes a stressful experience due to the challenges of making a collective choice that satisfies everyone's personal taste. Additionally, the dominance of franchises in the market has made it difficult to discover and support local culinary gems. The abundance of differing reviews further adds to the confusion and uncertainty surrounding dining choices.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Value Proposition: </strong>
                    <br>
                    Tasteradar offers a solution by creating and joining groups that allow users to find food options that cater to everyone's preferences. To ensure quality over quantity, the app limits the food selection to three options. Furthermore, we provide user-personalized suggestions by combining user feedback (with permission) and synthesizing it into comprehensive recommendations. By focusing on local owners, Tasteradar helps users discover and support unique local venues.

                        <h3 class="article">Best enjoyed together</h3>
                        <p>
                            To emphasize shared dining experiences, we introduced a feature that prompts first-time users to create or join groups. Additionally, to streamline the onboarding process, we implemented single sign-on with Google. 
                            Our aim was to offer an experience that could be enjoyed on the go or planned in advance. Through user interviews, we identified the essential filters and prioritized them based on their significance. 
                            Users can easily save their dietary preferences and restrictions for future use, ensuring a personalized and convenient experience.

                        <p>
                            To enhance the personalized experience of Tasteradar, we improved our food finder algorithm with a push towards exploration. 
                            Through user research, we found that people enjoyed trying a range of foods, leading us to adjust our filter system to differentiate between "must-haves" and "preferences." 
                            Some options were made to reset with each search, while users could still save their favorite restaurants. Consistent price ranges were also implemented based on user feedback. 
                            Our unique selling point focuses on discovering food based on preferences rather than relying solely on restaurant names and reviews. Users can explore through restaurant listings or the map view for additional exploration. 
                            These enhancements offer a tailored experience, guiding users towards exciting culinary discoveries that align with their tastes and preferences.

                <h2>More about the design process</h2>
                <p>
                    User Research: We began by conducting in-depth user research to gain insights into the pain points and needs of our target audience.
                <br>
                User Flows and Information Architecture: Based on our research findings, we developed user flows and crafted an effective information architecture for the app.
                <br>
                Wireframing and Prototyping: With the user flows and information architecture in place, we moved on to wireframing and prototyping.
                <br>
                Visual Design: Once the wireframes were validated, we transitioned to the visual design phase.
                <br>
                Usability Testing: To ensure the usability and effectiveness of our design, we conducted rigorous usability testing sessions with real users.
                <br>
                Iterative Design: Armed with insights from usability testing, we iteratively refined the app's design and addressed any identified usability issues.
                <br>
                Collaborative Design Reviews: Throughout the design process, I facilitated collaborative design reviews with the team.
                <br>
                Development Collaboration: Working closely with the development lead, I provided design specifications, assets, and guidance to ensure seamless collaboration between design and development.
                <br>
                Continuous Improvement: We actively sought user feedback, monitored analytics, and conducted user surveys to gather insights and drive future design enhancements.
                <br>
                Conclusion: Our user-centered design approach, combined with usability testing and iterative design, resulted in an app that delivers an intuitive and delightful user experience.

                            <p>Through extensive user research, market analysis, and iterative design, we have successfully developed a working prototype that simplifies the process of finding and choosing local food experiences. Our goal is to create a vibrant community of food enthusiasts who are passionate about exploring the rich flavors available in the Netherlands.

                            <p>Government Agency Collaborations: Collaborating with government agencies that support local businesses and cultural initiatives to amplify our impact and expand our reach. These include: Netherlands Board of Tourism and Conventions (NBTC) and local municipality councils.</p>

                            <p>Social Media Presence: We briefly worked with a contractor (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/ariadarkbloom" target="_blank">Aria</a>, Marketing) to grow our social platforms by engaging with users, share compelling content, and foster a sense of community around Tasteradar. 
                                Our plan was to collaborate with popular food-focused Instagrammers, such as <a class="subtle" href="https://www.instagram.com/fooddeco" target="_blank">@fooddeco</a>, 
                                <a class="subtle" href="https://www.instagram.com/mykitchenskills" target="_blank">@mykitchenskills</a>, and <a class="subtle" href="https://www.instagram.com/dutchfoodie" target="_blank">@dutchfoodie</a>, 
                                to promote Tasteradar and share their experiences using the app.</p>

                            <p>Restaurant Discounts and Recommendations: Offering exclusive discounts and personalized recommendations to incentivize users to explore local venues and enhance their dining experiences.</p>

                            <h3 class="article">Teamwork & Collaboration:</h3>
                            <p>In our team, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/diederickgeers" target="_blank">Diederick</a> took the lead in project planning and management, ensuring that our goals and milestones were aligned. I, as the UX and marketing lead, played a crucial role in shaping the user experience, conducting research, and developing marketing strategies to attract and engage our target audience.  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cas.hutten" target="_blank">Cas</a>, with his expertise in development, brought our vision to life through his technical prowess.

                                One area where we identified a gap in our team was the absence of a dedicated financial and business advisor. Moving forward, we recognized the importance of having an advisor to provide guidance on financial planning, investment strategies, and overall business development. With the inclusion of such an advisor, we would have been better equipped to navigate the financial aspects of the startup and make informed decisions for future growth.
                                <br><br>
                                Despite the decision to put the project on hold after reaching the finals of a local startup competition, we remain optimistic about the future of Tasteradar. We eagerly await renewed opportunities and motivation to reignite our passion for simplifying the search for local food experiences in the Netherlands.

                            <p>In 2022, Tasteradar gained recognition by reaching the finals of a local startup competition (Tailors Den) for investment funds in Tilburg. 
                                Although we did not win the prize, this experience provided valuable validation of our concept and highlighted areas where we could strengthen our business proposition. Feedback from the competition organizers indicated that our competitive advantage, our "moat," needed further development to stand out in the market.
                            <br>
                            As a result, we made the decision to put the project on hold. After two years of intense development, we realized that our motivation had waned. 
                            However, we remain open to revisiting the project in the future, especially considering the advancements in language-based AI models and their potential impact on review curation and personalized restaurant data.
                            <br>
                            This journey has been a tremendous learning opportunity in entrepreneurship, allowing me to grow and mature as a designer. Although the team has disbanded, I am excited to continue working on side projects and providing value as a designer and creator. 
                            I am grateful for the insights gained throughout this process and look forward to applying them in future endeavors, always striving to create meaningful and user-centered solutions.
